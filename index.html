<p>Hello! I'm Nishat Tabassum, a chemical engineering graduate from Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology, where I'm currently pursuing a masters degree and also teaching full-time as a lecturer.
    As a researcher, my work is at the interface of chemistry, biology and materials science. I've been involved in education since the beginning of my undergraduate studies, and I consider myself fortunate that I can build my career out of what I enjoy, which is teaching.
I am affiliated with <a href = "http://shoebahmed.buet.ac.bd/">Dr. Shoeb Ahmed's QEB research group</a> since 2018, where we worked on developing low-cost microbial fuel cells for treatment of heavy metals in textile sludge. My current project involves designing hydrogels for a variety of biomedical applications under the 
co-supervision of <a href = "https://www.otago.ac.nz/healthsciences/expertise/profile/index.html?id=3407"> Dr. Azam Ali </a> at the University of Otago.</p>
</p>
<p>When I'm not in the classroom or the lab, I'm usually buried in a book or taking a walk in nature. But most days, I just rewatch episodes of old British sitcoms.</p>
