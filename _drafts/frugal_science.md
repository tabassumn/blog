One of the greatest barriers to pracitising science in the developing world is the lack of access to expensive analytical instruments and equipment, some often unheard of by a researcher unless they've had the chance to visit a well-equipped lab. This can be a significant problem in clinical labs, where ensuring quality results is critical, and testing can make all the difference between succumbing to an infectious disease and fighting it [(1](https://labmedicineblog.com/2017/11/06/the-challenges-of-clinical-laboratories-in-developing-countries/), [2)](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10703780/).

[Dr. Manu Prakash](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018APS..MARP61004P/abstract) at Stanford, a physicist whose mission is to improve global health through the use of [ultra-affordable devices](https://today.mims.com/frugal-science--one-man-s-quest-to-revolutionise-healthcare-and-science), introduced the concept of 'frugal science'. The idea is to go back to the basics: use crude tools and easily accessible materials to design complex devices that don't even need external power to operate, eliminating several of the hurdles that prevent adoption of biomedical devices in resource-poor settings.

It is not easy to innovate without relying on advanced technology at a time where technology is a valuable commodity
