There's a strangely liberating feeling that I got when I decided I was no 
longer going to be a mindless social media zombie. The pandemic forced all of us to 
seek the human connections we were suddenly on the brink of losing in real life. Naturally 
we all gravitated towards social media to connect, dare I say, a bit [more agressively](https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/blog/norms-matter/202004/social-media-in-pandemic-the-good-news-and-the-bad-news). But with the doubled-down exposure, there comes a risk of [information overload](https://www.irishtimes.com/news/education/social-media-overload-linked-to-fatigue-1.4191997). Until you wake up one day to realize you can't recall much about what you did yesterday (hint: you probably didn't do much), and remember more of what your extended network did. Everyone who has quit or deactivated their accounts describes a tipping point, when it no longer (makes sense)[https://www.rd.com/article/quitting-facebook/].

I do not have a dramatic befitting story. It's more of a practical and ideological choice. I could feel the pervasive quality that being online can have on productivity and cognition. It has been well-documented; in a book detailing the steady deterioration of our ability to focus, the author [Nicholas Carr](https://www.amazon.com/Shallows-What-Internet-Doing-Brains/dp/0393357821/?ascsubtag=[]vx[e]21072194[t]w[d]D) discusses why we take in more loq-quality information at the expense of high-level thinking, at a time when processing complex knowledge is the most valuable trait (a condensed version is in this [article](https://www.vox.com/podcasts/2020/7/1/21308153/the-ezra-klein-show-the-shallows-twitter-facebook-attention-deep-reading-thinking)).
