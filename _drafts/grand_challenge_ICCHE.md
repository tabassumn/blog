In 2008, visionary scientists across the globe proposed 14 challenges that engineers need to tackle in the coming decades 
that were tied to **sustainability**, **health**, **security** and, not surprisingly, **the joy of living**. These [grand challenges]
(http://www.engineeringchallenges.org/challenges.aspx) require pushing the limits of our knowledge and technological innovation to engineer solutions to problems that will impact
each of us and our future generations. Interestingly, 7 out of these 14 Grand Challenges for Engineering in the 21st century would require the skills of Chemical Engineers? 
In fact, I wouldn't be too far off to call this an age of renaissance for Chemical Engineering. The problems we're trying to address have 
far-reaching impact, while the solutions need to be more accessible and easily implementable. For the future Chemical Engineer, this is a grandest call to action.
