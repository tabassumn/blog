To the novice venturing into the world of research, the first skill they become adept at is cleaning glassware. Then comes tenacity. It is naive to think you will 'get' it 
at the outset. The planning, the adjusting, the derailing of said plans down to its failure- they're all part and parcel of any research work. I've learned a few lessons, which I would 
like to tell my sophomore self, but you really only pick up on these things as you go along. 

(Disclaimer: I'm told when I get to my PhD program, I'll have to relearn the lessons I've learnt now.)

1. It is imperative to establish a healthy relationship with disappointment earlier on: We get on average a year to work on our undergrad thesis. Since mine involved a topic completely new,
we spent close to six months just designing the electrodes and the fuel cells. Not out of will, it's simply the nature of things.
2. Prepare to be absolutely elated at one moment to completely morose the next:
3. Expect that even if something *sounds* interesting, doesn't necessarily mean it's worth it
