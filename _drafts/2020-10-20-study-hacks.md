I've been studying for quite some time now, and one of the questions I've been asked numerous times is 'How do you study?' This is followed by 'How should I study?', and the conversation almost invariably concludes with a dejected statement along the lines of 'I can't do that!' Studying isn't easy (no surprise), but a very smart engineering student once said, 'there's no such thing as a lazy successful engineer.' Effort pays, but more often than not, most of us resort to brute forcing (i.e., cramming) or busy-bodying (i.e., highlighting). These techniques *only* give the impression of studying, and we all know highlighting doesn't even work on hair.

Over the years, I've found that the habit that has really made the difference is practice. Practicing example problems, modifying the problems and practicing again, practicing solving problems on time- a tedious undertaking, but very much worth it. 'But there isn't enough time' you say. Well, that's where time management comes in.
