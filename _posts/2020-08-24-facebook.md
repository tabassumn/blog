There's a strangely liberating feeling that I got when I decided I was no 
longer going to be a mindless social media zombie. The pandemic forced all of us to 
seek the human connections we were suddenly on the brink of losing in real life. Naturally 
we all gravitated towards social media to connect, dare I say, a bit [more agressively](https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/blog/norms-matter/202004/social-media-in-pandemic-the-good-news-and-the-bad-news). But with the doubled-down exposure, there comes a risk of [information overload](https://www.irishtimes.com/news/education/social-media-overload-linked-to-fatigue-1.4191997). Until you wake up one day to realize you can't recall much about what you did yesterday, and remember more of what your extended network did. Everyone who has quit or deactivated their accounts describes a tipping point, when it no longer [makes sense](https://www.calnewport.com/blog/2020/05/20/let-go-to-grow-on-a-bloggers-decision-to-trade-social-media-for-a-quieter-life/). There are many impersonal arguments to quit social media, strongly grounded in research and anecdotal evidence; renowned computer scientist [Jaron Lainier](http://www.jaronlanier.com/) discussed them best in his book [Ten Arguments for Deleting Your Social Media Accounts Right Now](http://www.jaronlanier.com/tenarguments.html).

[Disclaimer: My arguments are based on Facebook. I don't use anything else. Instagram's privacy policy deterred me from using it, and I currently use a couple of messaging apps to keep in touch with those that truly matter. So it's not a decry against all apps, although they all operate using the same mechanics.]

I do not have a dramatic befitting story that precipitated my decision. It's more of a practical and ideological choice. I could feel the pervasive impact that being online can have on productivity and cognition. It has been well-documented: in a book detailing the steady deterioration of our ability to focus, the author [Nicholas Carr](https://www.amazon.com/Shallows-What-Internet-Doing-Brains/dp/0393357821/?ascsubtag=[]vx[e]21072194[t]w[d]D) discusses why we take in more low-quality information at the expense of high-level thinking, at a time when processing complex knowledge is a highly sought-after, valuable skill (a condensed version is in this [article](https://www.vox.com/podcasts/2020/7/1/21308153/the-ezra-klein-show-the-shallows-twitter-facebook-attention-deep-reading-thinking)). After deactivating, I found a sense of wholeness in my mind. I could focus deeply without interruption from any of the intrusive opinions that my newsfeed updates were a fodder for. In order to accomplish the kind of work I do, the ability to focus is [a practice worth cultivating](https://www.calnewport.com/books/deep-work/).

This pandemic has forced me to realize how little our curated lives, the rat-race, our bragging rights matter. There is an urgent need to reset, to contemplate about the world beyond our bubbles. I no longer feel the urge to craft a 2D catalog about my life, nor do I think it's right to assess a 3D individual based on their own catalog. Also, an always-accessible, always-online lifestyle, which is automatically expected of everyone who is on these platforms, is not sustainable. 

I'm also opposed to Facebook's privacy practices. Some say our own choices matter very little in influencing any change in this aspect. Maybe so, but despite knowing about the profit-driven data-mining, if we still choose to give up our data, then we are implicitly consenting to these malpractices. Privacy is an individual's right, and there are better ways to connect without having to barter it.

With these and many other ideas in mind, one fine afternoon in June, I pulled the plug on my account. When prompted, I jokingly ticked 'I don't know how to use Facebook'. On introspection I realized, maybe there is some truth to that statement.
