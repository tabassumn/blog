There's a strangely liberating feeling that I got when I decided I was going to deactivate my facebook account for an unforeseeable period of time. I had been on it since 2008, and contemplating getting out of it since 2017. Everyone who has quit or deactivated their accounts describes a tipping point, when it no longer [makes sense](https://www.calnewport.com/blog/2020/05/20/let-go-to-grow-on-a-bloggers-decision-to-trade-social-media-for-a-quieter-life/). There are many impersonal arguments to quit social media, strongly grounded in research and anecdotal evidence; renowned computer scientist [Jaron Lainier](www.jaronlanier.com) discussed them best in his book [Ten Arguments for Deleting Your Social Media Accounts Right Now](http://www.jaronlanier.com/tenarguments.html).

[Disclaimer: My arguments are based on Facebook. I currently use a couple of messaging apps to keep in touch with those that truly matter. So it's not a decry against all apps.]

I do not have a dramatic befitting story that precipitated my decision. It's more of a practical and ideological choice. I could feel the pervasive impact that being online can have on productivity and cognition. It has been well-documented: in a book detailing the steady deterioration of our ability to focus, the author [Nicholas Carr](https://www.amazon.com/Shallows-What-Internet-Doing-Brains/dp/0393357821/?ascsubtag=[]vx[e]21072194[t]w[d]D) discusses why we take in more low-quality information at the expense of high-level thinking, at a time when processing complex knowledge is a most valuable skill (a condensed version is in this [article](https://www.vox.com/podcasts/2020/7/1/21308153/the-ezra-klein-show-the-shallows-twitter-facebook-attention-deep-reading-thinking)). With facebook in particular, there comes a risk of [information overload](https://www.irishtimes.com/news/education/social-media-overload-linked-to-fatigue-1.4191997). After deactivating, I found a sense of wholeness in my mind. I could focus deeply without interruption from any of the intrusive opinions that my newsfeed updates were a fodder for. For the work that I do, the ability to focus is [a practice worth cultivating](https://www.calnewport.com/books/deep-work/).

This pandemic has forced me to realize how little our curated lives, the rat-race, our bragging rights matter. There is an urgent need to reset, to contemplate about the world beyond our bubbles. I no longer feel the urge to craft a 2D catalog about my life, nor do I think it's right to assess a 3D individual based on their own catalog. Also an always-accessible, always-online lifestyle, which is automatically expected of everyone who is on these platforms, is not sustainable. 

I'm also opposed to Facebook's privacy practices. Some say our own choices matter very little in influencing any change in this aspect. Maybe so, but despite knowing about the profit-driven data-mining, if we still choose to give up our data, then we are implicitly consenting to these malpractices. Privacy is an individual's right, and there are better ways to connect without having to barter it.

With these and many other ideas in mind, one fine afternoon in June, I pulled the plug on my account. And contrary to even my expectations, I feel free.
